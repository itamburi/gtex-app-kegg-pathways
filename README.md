## Exploring Inter-Tissue Gene Correlations within Targeted KEGG Pathways and their Expression Patterns in GTEx

### Raw Data:
The *working_dataset* object, loaded and filtered in **code/01 KEGG pathway correlations between tissues.R** (lines 14-21), was derived from our prior analysis (https://github.com/Leandromvelez/myokine-signaling)

That GTEx object can also be found at this google drive link (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YKT8lkGzGVFk74CqS5FmT6lIH0ZVfgfJ) and is called **GTEx NA included env.RData**
