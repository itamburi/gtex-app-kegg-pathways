## Exploring Inter-Tissue Gene Correlations within Targeted KEGG Pathways and their Expression Patterns in GTEx

### Raw Data:
The *working_dataset* object which loaded, filtered, and transposed in **code/01 KEGG pathway correlations between tissues.R** (lines 14-21), was derived from our prior analysis (https://github.com/Leandromvelez/myokine-signaling)

The complete GTEx env.RData object (loaded in line 15) can also be found at this google drive link (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YKT8lkGzGVFk74CqS5FmT6lIH0ZVfgfJ) and is called **GTEx NA included env.RData**

The GTEx object is not included in this git repository simply due to upload size constraints
